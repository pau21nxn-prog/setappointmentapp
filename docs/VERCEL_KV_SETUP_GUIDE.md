# Step-by-Step Guide: Create Vercel KV Database

## Overview

This guide will help you create a Vercel KV (Redis) database to enable rate limiting for your SetAppointmentApp. The entire process takes about 5-10 minutes.

**What is Vercel KV?**

- Redis-compatible database
- Global edge network (ultra-fast)
- Automatic scaling
- Free tier: 30 MB storage, 10,000 commands/day
- Perfect for rate limiting

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- ‚úÖ Vercel account (already have this)
- ‚úÖ SetAppointmentApp deployed on Vercel
- ‚úÖ Access to your Vercel Dashboard

---

## Step 1: Access Vercel Dashboard

### 1.1 Log in to Vercel

1. Go to: https://vercel.com
2. Click **"Log In"** (top right)
3. Sign in with your account

### 1.2 Navigate to Your Project

1. You'll see your dashboard with all projects
2. Find and click on **"setappointmentapp"** project
3. You should see the project overview page

**‚úÖ Checkpoint:** You're viewing your project dashboard with tabs like "Deployments", "Settings", "Analytics"

---

## Step 2: Create KV Database

### 2.1 Open Storage Tab

1. In the top navigation bar, click **"Storage"**
   - It's next to "Deployments", "Analytics", etc.
2. You'll see the Storage page with different database options

KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN   Production, Preview, Development
KV_URL                   Production, Preview, Development
```

**‚úÖ Checkpoint:** All KV environment variables are added to your project

---

## Step 6: Redeploy Application

### 6.1 Why Redeploy?

Environment variables are only applied to **new deployments**. Your currently running app doesn't have the KV credentials yet.

### 6.2 Trigger Redeployment

**Option A: Via Deployments Tab (Easiest)**

1. Click **"Deployments"** tab (top navigation)
2. Find your latest deployment (top of the list)
3. Click the **"‚ãØ"** (three dots) menu on the right
4. Click **"Redeploy"**
5. In the popup, click **"Redeploy"** button
6. Wait 1-2 minutes for the deployment to complete

**Option B: Via Git Push (Alternative)**

1. Make any small change to your code (e.g., add a comment)
2. Commit and push:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore: trigger redeploy for KV environment variables"
   git push
   ```
3. Vercel automatically deploys

### 6.3 Wait for Deployment

1. You'll see the deployment progress with a spinner
2. Status changes: **Building** ‚Üí **Deploying** ‚Üí **Ready**
3. When you see **"Ready"** with a green checkmark, it's done!

**‚úÖ Checkpoint:** Your app is redeployed with KV credentials

---

## Step 7: Verify Rate Limiting Works

### 7.1 Visit Your Live Site

1. In your Vercel dashboard, find your deployment
2. Click **"Visit"** or go to: `https://setappointmentapp.vercel.app`

### 7.2 Test Rate Limiting

**Test 1: Normal Usage (Should Work)**

1. Fill out the booking form
2. Submit it
3. ‚úÖ Should succeed normally

**Test 2: Rate Limit (Should Block)**

1. Submit the form again immediately
2. Submit a 3rd time
3. Submit a 4th time (within the same hour)
4. On the 4th submission, you should see:
   ```json
   {
     "error": "Too Many Requests",
     "message": "You have exceeded the maximum number of booking attempts..."
   }
   ```
5. Or be redirected to `/429` page

**‚úÖ Checkpoint:** Rate limiting is working! You can only submit 3 forms per hour.

---

## Step 8: Monitor KV Usage

### 8.1 View Database Metrics

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Click **"Storage"** tab
3. Click on **"setappointmentapp-ratelimit"**
4. You'll see metrics:
   - **Commands:** Number of Redis operations
   - **Storage:** Data size (should be minimal)
   - **Bandwidth:** Network usage

### 8.2 Check Rate Limit Keys

1. On the KV database page, click **"Data Browser"** tab
2. You'll see keys that look like:
   ```
   ratelimit:form:123.456.789.0
   ratelimit:api:123.456.789.0
   ```
3. These are the rate limit counters per IP address
4. They automatically expire after the time window (1 hour for forms)

**‚úÖ Checkpoint:** You can monitor rate limiting activity

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem 1: Variables Not Showing Up

**Solution:**

- Make sure you selected all environments (Production, Preview, Development)
- Redeploy the application
- Wait 2-3 minutes after redeployment

### Problem 2: Rate Limiting Not Working

**Symptoms:** Can submit more than 3 forms per hour

**Check:**

1. Verify environment variables are set:
   - Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   - Confirm `KV_REST_API_URL` and `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` exist
2. Check if you recently redeployed (needed for variables to apply)
3. Open browser DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
4. Submit form and look for response headers:
   ```
   X-RateLimit-Limit: 3
   X-RateLimit-Remaining: 2
   ```
   If you don't see these headers, rate limiting isn't active

**Solution:**

- Redeploy your application
- Clear your browser cache
- Try from incognito/private window

### Problem 3: Error Creating Database

**Error:** "Failed to create database"

**Solutions:**

- Check if you're on the free plan (might need to remove old KV databases)
- Try a different database name
- Contact Vercel support if issue persists

### Problem 4: KV Database Not Connecting

**Error in logs:** "Failed to connect to Redis"

**Solutions:**

1. Verify the `KV_REST_API_URL` format:
   - Should start with `https://`
   - Should end with `.kv.vercel-storage.com`
2. Check the token isn't truncated when copying
3. Recreate the KV database if needed

## Free Tier Limits

Vercel KV Free Tier includes:

- ‚úÖ **30 MB storage** (plenty for rate limiting)
- ‚úÖ **10,000 commands/day** (more than enough)
- ‚úÖ **100 GB bandwidth/month**

**For SetAppointmentApp:**

- Each form submission = 2-3 Redis commands
- 10,000 commands = ~3,000-5,000 form submissions/day
- **You're well within limits!**

If you exceed limits:

- Vercel will email you
- You can upgrade to Pro tier ($20/month for 256 MB)

---

## Security Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Do:

- Keep your KV tokens secret (never commit to Git)
- Use environment variables (already done)
- Monitor usage regularly
- Set up Vercel alerting

### ‚ùå Don't:

- Share your `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` publicly
- Commit `.env.local` file to Git
- Use same token for multiple projects
- Disable rate limiting in production
