# üö® URGENT: Supabase Configuration Required

**Issue Fixed:** Code changes are complete and deployed.
**Action Required:** You must update Supabase configuration manually.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Fix Supabase Site URL (CRITICAL)

1. Go to: [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/admhufdnjkbkdyrfalck/auth/url-configuration)
2. Find **Site URL** field
3. **Current value:** `setappointmentapp.vercel.app` ‚ùå
4. **Change to:** `https://setappointmentapp.vercel.app` ‚úÖ
5. Click **Save changes**

**Why:** Missing `https://` protocol causes Supabase to generate incorrect URLs.

---

### Step 2: Add API Callback URL to Redirect URLs Allowlist

1. Stay in the same Supabase page (URL Configuration)
2. Scroll to **Redirect URLs** section
3. Click **Add URL** button
4. Enter: `https://setappointmentapp.vercel.app/api/admin/auth/callback`
5. Click **Add** or **Save**

**Why:** New magic links redirect to the API route (not the page route) so cookies can be set properly.

---

### Step 3: Verify Your Configuration

Your **Redirect URLs** list should now include:

- ‚úÖ `https://setappointmentapp.vercel.app/**`
- ‚úÖ `https://setappointmentapp.vercel.app/admin/auth/callback` (old - can keep)
- ‚úÖ `https://setappointmentapp.vercel.app/api/admin/auth/callback` (NEW - required!)
- ‚úÖ `http://localhost:3000/**` (for development)

**Site URL** should be:

- ‚úÖ `https://setappointmentapp.vercel.app`

---

## üß™ Testing the Fix

### After Updating Supabase:

1. **Clear browser cookies** (important!)
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Application ‚Üí Cookies
   - Delete all cookies for setappointmentapp.vercel.app

2. **Request a NEW magic link**
   - Go to: https://setappointmentapp.vercel.app/admin/login
   - Enter your admin email
   - Click "Send Magic Link"

3. **Check your email**
   - Look for the magic link
   - Hover over the link (don't click yet)
   - Verify it contains: `/api/admin/auth/callback` (with "api" in the path)

4. **Click the magic link**
   - Should redirect to: `/api/admin/auth/callback`
   - Then redirect to: `/admin/dashboard`
   - Should stay logged in (no loop back to login)

5. **Verify Vercel logs**
   - Go to Vercel ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí Latest ‚Üí Functions
   - Look for `/api/admin/auth/callback` logs
   - Should see: "Session created successfully"
   - Should NOT see: "Error removing cookie"

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

You'll know it's working when:

1. ‚úÖ Magic link email contains `/api/admin/auth/callback` in URL
2. ‚úÖ Clicking link redirects to dashboard
3. ‚úÖ No redirect loop back to login
4. ‚úÖ Can access admin features without re-authenticating
5. ‚úÖ Vercel logs show successful session creation
6. ‚úÖ No "Error removing cookie" in logs

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still redirecting to login

**Possible causes:**

- Browser cookies not cleared ‚Üí Clear all cookies and try again
- Using old magic link ‚Üí Request a fresh magic link
- Supabase config not saved ‚Üí Double-check both Site URL and Redirect URLs

### Issue: "Redirect URL not allowed" error

**Cause:** New API callback URL not added to Supabase allowlist
**Fix:** Ensure `https://setappointmentapp.vercel.app/api/admin/auth/callback` is in Redirect URLs

### Issue: Still see "Error removing cookie" in logs

**Cause:** Using cached/old deployment
**Fix:**

1. Go to Vercel deployments
2. Trigger a manual redeploy of the latest commit
3. Wait for deployment to complete
4. Try again with fresh magic link

---

## üìù What Changed (Technical Details)

### Root Cause

The callback page was a Server Component trying to set cookies during `exchangeCodeForSession()`. In Next.js 15+, Server Components cannot modify cookies, causing the session to fail silently.

### Solution

1. Created a Route Handler at `/api/admin/auth/callback/route.ts`
   - Route Handlers CAN modify cookies
   - Handles auth code exchange and session creation
   - Returns proper redirects with cookies set

2. Updated magic link to redirect to API route
   - Old: `/admin/auth/callback` (page - can't set cookies)
   - New: `/api/admin/auth/callback` (API - can set cookies)

3. Converted callback page to simple loading page
   - Acts as fallback if someone directly accesses the page
   - Redirects to API route for actual processing

## üìû Need Help?

If still experiencing issues after following these steps:

1. Check Vercel function logs for specific errors
2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Verify Supabase Auth Logs for authentication failures
4. Ensure deployment succeeded and is live
