```bash
# Branch from main (production)
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-issue-description
```

#### Step 2: Fix Bug Quickly

1. Reproduce bug
2. Write failing test
3. Implement minimal fix
4. Verify test passes
5. Test manually

```bash

## Rollback Procedures

### Option 1: Vercel Rollback (Fastest - Recommended)

**When to use**: Recent deployment caused issues, previous version was stable.

**Steps**:

1. **Via Vercel Dashboard**:
   - Go to Vercel dashboard
   - Select project
   - Go to "Deployments" tab
   - Find last stable deployment
   - Click "..." menu
   - Click "Promote to Production"
   - Confirm

2. **Via Vercel CLI**:

```bash
# List recent deployments
vercel ls

# Rollback to specific deployment
vercel rollback [deployment-url]
```

**Time**: ~2 minutes

### Option 2: Git Revert (Permanent)

**When to use**: Need to permanently revert changes in git history.

**Steps**:

```bash
# Revert the problematic commit
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git revert HEAD

# Or revert multiple commits
git revert HEAD~3..HEAD

# Push revert commit
git push origin main

# This triggers automatic redeployment
```

**Time**: ~5 minutes (including deployment)

### Option 3: Redeploy Previous Commit

**When to use**: Need to deploy a specific previous version.

**Steps**:

```bash
# Find commit hash of stable version
git log --oneline

# Reset to that commit
git checkout main
git reset --hard [commit-hash]

# Force push (‚ö†Ô∏è use with caution)
git push origin main --force

# This triggers automatic redeployment
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: Only use for emergencies. Force push rewrites history.

**Time**: ~5 minutes

### Rollback Decision Matrix

| Issue                          | Recommended Method | Time   |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------ | ------ |
| Recent deploy broken           | Vercel Rollback    | 2 min  |
| Need to keep git history clean | Git Revert         | 5 min  |
| Multiple commits bad           | Git Reset          | 5 min  |
| Database migration involved    | Manual + Rollback  | 15 min |

---

## Database Migrations

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Database changes require extra care.

### Forward Migration (Safe)

**Adding new tables/columns** (non-breaking):

1. **Create migration script**:

```sql
-- migrations/001_add_email_logs_table.sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS email_logs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  appointment_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES appointments(id),
  email_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  sent_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL
);
```

2. **Run in Supabase dashboard** before deployment

3. **Deploy code** that uses new schema

4. **Verify** migration successful

### Backward Migration (Risky)

**Removing/changing tables/columns** (breaking):

1. **Plan migration carefully**
2. **Create rollback script**
3. **Test on staging first**
4. **Coordinate with team**
5. **Deploy during low-traffic time**
6. **Monitor closely**
7. **Keep rollback script ready**

**Breaking change checklist**:

- [ ] Rollback script prepared
- [ ] Data backup created
- [ ] Tested on staging
- [ ] Team notified
- [ ] Low-traffic time chosen
- [ ] Monitoring ready

---

## Environment Variables

### Adding New Environment Variables

#### Step 1: Update .env.example

```bash
# .env.example
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_key
NEW_VARIABLE=your_new_variable  # <-- Add new variable
```

#### Step 2: Add to Vercel

**Via Vercel Dashboard**:

1. Go to project settings
2. Click "Environment Variables"
3. Add variable name and value
4. Select environments (Production, Preview, Development)
5. Click "Save"

**Via Vercel CLI**:

```bash
# Add production variable
vercel env add NEW_VARIABLE production

# Add preview variable
vercel env add NEW_VARIABLE preview

# Add development variable
vercel env add NEW_VARIABLE development
```

#### Step 3: Add to GitHub Secrets (for CI/CD)

1. Go to repository settings
2. Click "Secrets and variables" ‚Üí "Actions"
3. Click "New repository secret"
4. Add name and value
5. Click "Add secret"

#### Step 4: Redeploy

```bash
# Trigger redeployment to load new variables
vercel --prod

# Or push a commit to trigger automatic deployment
```

## Cloudflare Cache Management

### Manual Cache Purge

**When to purge**:

- After deployment (automatic in CI/CD)
- After fixing static asset issues
- When users see old content

**Via Cloudflare Dashboard**:

1. Login to Cloudflare
2. Select your domain
3. Go to "Caching" ‚Üí "Configuration"
4. Click "Purge Everything"
5. Confirm

**Via API**:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/${CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID}/purge_cache" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"purge_everything":true}'
```

**Via selective purge** (specific files):

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/${CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID}/purge_cache" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "files": [
      "https://yourdomain.com/path/to/file.js",
      "https://yourdomain.com/path/to/image.jpg"
    ]
  }'
```

### Verify Cache Purge

```bash
# Check cache status in response headers
curl -I https://yourdomain.com

# Look for:
# cf-cache-status: HIT (cached) or MISS (not cached)
# age: 0 (freshly cached)
```
